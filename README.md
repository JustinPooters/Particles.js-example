# âš¡ Particles.JS

Welcome! I have created a cool example of Particles.JS! You can find the project's download by [clicking here](https://github.com/JustinPooters/Particles.js-example/tree/master/src)!

## Used programming languages

For this project, the following programming language(s): [Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/), HTML & CSS

## Cool, but what did you acutally create here?

I created a simple background for any website using Particles.JS, this makes it look cool with simple animations, also noticed how they respond to your mouse? ðŸ˜‰

## How do i use this code?!

Well, You can just get everything from the `src` folder and change what is needed. to only have the background without the box, remove the `<text>` tag in the index.html
